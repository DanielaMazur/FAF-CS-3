# FAF.CS16.1

# Introduction

The aim of the project is to develop a Security Benchmarking Tool as a desktop application.

### Lab 1: Importing Compliance Audit Policies

- Import the manually downloaded policies from a predefined trusted location;
- Parse and understand the format of data within the imported policy;
- Save the same set of policies under a different name within a structured form (ex: database).

### Lab 2: Creating Custom Audit Policies

- Choose which options they would like to run (by selecting or deselecting options);
- Search by name for an option (via a search bar);
- Select or deselect all options in one click;
- Create and save a policy that contains only the selected options under the same name or
  a different one.

### Lab 3: Auditing a Workstation

- Perform an audit of the workstation, using the options that were selected;
- Output the results of the audit on screen

### Lab 4: Enforcing a Policy

- Select the settings to be enforced (a subset of ”Failed”, or all of them);
- Enforce the policy on at least 5 settings (edit the selected settings in your system);
- Rollback to the system’s initial settings.
