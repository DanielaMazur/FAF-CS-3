The aim of the project is to develop a Security Benchmarking Tool as a desktop application.

### Lab 1: Importing Compliance Audit Policies

- Parse and understand the format of data within the imported policy;
- Save the same set of policies under a different name within a structured form (ex: database).
### Lab 2: Creating Custom Audit Policies
- Choose which options they would like to run (by selecting or deselecting options);
- Search by name for an option (via a search bar);

a different one.
